# Pygame-3D-Engine
This is a 3D engine made in Pygame.
This took about 3 months to make (2 months even)
It does not have any texture mapping yet, but will figure it out soon.
The vertical height rendering scaling is kind of off. The lower the height you occupy, the lower the camera will be. This is the opposite for higher camera heights.
